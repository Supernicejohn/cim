# cim
A modal editor for ComputerCraft, inspired by a famous editor with a similar name!

This first version covers the most basic of functionality, in order to make the editor self-hosting.
A single-file program, with limited usefulness. The plan however is as follows:
Implement things that *I* frequently use in Vim, which is:
HJKL navigation in normal mode (done)
/ Search
:<line #> Jump
Registers for yank/paste & delete
Visual mode
UI changes, line numbers & more info in lower bar
A command interpreter at all

---
Other than that, more fleshed out features overall, trying to create a usable vim-like CC editor.
